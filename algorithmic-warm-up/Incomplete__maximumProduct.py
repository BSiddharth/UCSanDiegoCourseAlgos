# Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers.
# By distinct it means that the postion of the numbers need to be different.
# fastest way will be to sort and multiply the last two but we will use pair method here.

# so what is pair method you ask? Well it is this https://stackoverflow.com/a/9890581/11704526

inputList = input("Enter the list here: ")

for index in len(inputList):
    pass

# doesnt make any sense............
